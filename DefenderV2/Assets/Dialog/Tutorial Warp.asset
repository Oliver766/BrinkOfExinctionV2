  - "Okay kid, can you hear me? Good. Now listen up, I have the unfortunate task
    of\_somehow getting you in fighting shape before these bastards wipe us out."
  - "Personally,\_you weren\u2019t my first choice for this, but you\u2019re the

    the Avenger myself, I would have."
  - "You\u2019re currently en-route to what\u2019s left of our homeworld. I don\u2019t
    have to tell you how much we\u2019ve lost to these bastards, but I thought bringing
    you here would remind you of what we\u2019re fighting for\u2026"
  - "Alright kid, you\u2019re on the approach vector now, hold on to your knickers
    whilst we drop you out of warp..."
