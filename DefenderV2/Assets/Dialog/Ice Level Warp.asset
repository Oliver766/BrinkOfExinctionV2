  - Okay soldier, you're now heading to Zeta Giant. This flash frozen hunk of ice
    is being terraformed by the invaders as we speak.
  - I propose we throw a little wrench into those plans and introduce them to the
    business end of Terran firepower.
  - The terraforming detachment is small and shouldn't be expecting us. Shock and
    awe soldier, shock and awe.
